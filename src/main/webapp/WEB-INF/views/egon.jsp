	<p>Dr. Egon Spengler is the Ghostbusters' most scientific and logical mind. For him, everything is either quantifiable or
	should be scientifically tested. In a field of science where almost everything is considered superstition, old wives' tales,
	religious mythology, or just plain unprovable, Egon has made it his life's work to prove everyone wrong through the correct
	application of the scientific method. Dr. Spengler rarely allows his emotions to cloud his judgment and always maintains
	an open, analytical mind. Spengler is not just a passive observer, however. He is a prolific inventor. His creative spirit
	has led to many of the Ghostbusters' most effective tools, such as the proton pack.</p><br>
