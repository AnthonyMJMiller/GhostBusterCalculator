<h2>About the Founders</h2><br><br>

<p>The Ghostbusters were founded in New York City in 1984 by parapsychologists Dr. Peter Venkman, Dr. Raymond Stanz, and Dr. Egon Spengler.
After a harrowing encounter at the New York Public Library, with the ghost of former librarian Eleanor Twitty, These enterprising ecto-hunters
discovered that with a little know-how, and the right nuclear-powered particle accelerator, a ghost could be captured and
held indefinitely! Thus, the Ghostbusters were born.<br><br>

After a sizable mortgage loan they purchased an abandoned firehouse as their base of operations, developed their ghost-catching
gadgets, hired receptionist Janine Melnitz, found the perfect vehicle, started an add campaign and began their exploits 
creating the new field of paranormal elimination.<br><br>

Their first endeavor was capturing a troublesome glutton of a spirit at the Sedgewick Hotel. Afterwards the exploits of these
spectre-snaring scientists quickly became the stuff of legend. Business soon became almost more than the team could handle, so
they eventually hired the newest addition to the team, Winston Zeddemore. An initially skeptical man, Winston quickly became 
a full believer in the paranormal. He is the wise, commonsensical everyman of the group who keep a healthy
skepticism while still pursuing the vaporous apparitions plauging the populous. He has remained with the organization 
ever since.</p><br><br>
