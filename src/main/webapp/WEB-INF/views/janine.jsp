<h2>Janine Melnitz</h2><br><br><br>

<div class="container-custom"><br>
	<p>Saucy. Chic. Cranky. Overworked. Of the many adjectives that can be used to describe Janine Melnitz, perhaps "supportive"
	is the best fitting. As the Ghostbusters' secretary and receptionist, Janine holds the team together. When, at first, everyone
	in NYC believed the Ghostbusters to be phonies, Janine showed up to work on time everyday and dutifully executed her responsibilities.
	That is, until they actually started getting calls, at which point she still showed up to work, but became increasingly cranky.
	Cranky or not, she genuinely cares about each of the Ghostbusters and even shares her receptionist area with the
	Ghostbusters' unofficial pet, Slimer. Without her, the firehouse would fall apart.</p><br>
