	<p>While the other Ghostbusters are scientists-or perhaps because they are-their fourth member is not. Winston Zeddemore
	is no slouch in he brains department, but he doesn't have the same experience scientifically studying paranormal phenomena
	as his three partners. While Egon, Ray, and even Peter can get caught up thinking scientifically about a puzzling situation,
	it's Zeddemore's unique perspective that can often shed light on matters. Of the four Ghostbusters, Zeddemore is the only 
	one who expresses interest in (typical) religious ideology. Though at first he wasn't a believer in the supernatural, his
	time as a Ghostbuster quickly changed his mind. Ironically, he's never wavered in his faith. In fact, rather than seeing
	paranormal events through a scientific eye, Winston Zedeemore can filter everything through his spiritual beliefs.</p><br>
