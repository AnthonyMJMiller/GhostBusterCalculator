	<p>Sometimes called "Onionhead" or simply "the Mean Green Ghost", Ray purportedly named this creature "Slimer" specifically
	to annoy Peter (who still carries a long-standing distrust of the creature). Regardless of what he's called, this focused, non-terminal
	repeating phantasm personifies gluttony and is drawn to anything edible. While he isn't especially malicious, you don't want
	to be between him and a snack. Use caution when he's hungry, which is all the time. Slimer is the first Ghost that the team
	ever caught, and has become the unofficial mascot of the Ghostbusters.</p><br>
