	<p>Perhaps no other Ghostbuster embodies the inquisitive, childlike spirit of discovery like Dr. Ray Stantz. With a mind
	as gifted as Egon's, Stantz applies his keen intellect to paranormal studies with a special fervor akin to a kid in a toy
	factory. Rather than fear the unknown, Ray cherishes it for what he can learn from it. Unfortunately, while Ray's openness makes
	him the perfect scientist for paranormal studies, it also makes him vulnerable to the less savory aspects of the field (such as
	spiritual possession and unwittingly falling into devilish traps). Make no mistake about it, though, Dr. Stantz is no fool.
	He's just more inclined to gape in wonder and awe at a malevolent spirit than to run the other way.</p><br>
