	<p>Peter Venkman is a gifted intellect. He has PhDs in Parapsychology and Psychology. If his appetite for science were
	as voracious as his appetite for the fairer sex, Dr. Venkman would be a Nobel Prize-winning scientist. In fact, if there is
	any one thing that distracts Venkman from his scientific endeavors-aside from his underdeveloped sense of responsibility-it's women.
	Despite all of his shortcomings as a dedicated scientist, he is dedicated to the Ghostbusters. His wit is legendary, his courage
	is unflappable, and his charisma is unchallenged. When not chasing ghosts or women-not always in that order-Venkman enjoys
	long walks on the beach, quiet nights with a book and finding new ways to irritate Egon. (He insisted the last part be
	included in his bio.)</p><br>
